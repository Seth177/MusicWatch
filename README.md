# MusicWatch
Music Watch is a standalone program that intagrates with a discord bot to provide functanality for a command utalizing a local api for a application

This script once complete will utalize a websocket api exposed by the [Unoffical Google Play Music Desktop Client](https://github.com/MarshallOfSound/Google-Play-Music-Desktop-Player-UNOFFICIAL-) and integrate it with a command that is avaliable through my discord bot [Scratch](https://discord.ratchtnet.com)

####This project is mostly a side one to help me learn how to use githubs electron, if i am sucessful this will lead into a much larger project to build a full management interface for discord that utalizes my bot for a more in depth management of your discord server.
